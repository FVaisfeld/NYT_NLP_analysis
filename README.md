New York Times headline regression analysis with LLM
The Archive API returns an array of New York Times (NYT) articles for a specific month, spanning all the way back to 1851. I aim to evaluate the potential of a large language model for regression tasks, specifically predicting the publication date solely based on the article headlines. The resulting model could be utilized for exploratory analysis, examining the evolution of language over time. For instance, it could be employed to investigate how historical events influence language patterns.
